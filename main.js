//Ive lost my pyjamas!
//I live in an array and in one of the room i left my pyjamas!
//Also I'm a bit of a slob so everything is messy and all jumbled up...
//Can you please help me find them?

//Find the index in the array that has an anagram of the word 'pyjamas' and return that number!

//👉 Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
export function findPyjamas(arr) {
  //CODE GOES HERE
}
